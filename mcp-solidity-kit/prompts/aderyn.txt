aderyn --help
Aderyn - Rust based Solidity Static analyzer.

Quickstart:
cd my-solidity-project/
aderyn

It outputs report.md if the solidity project is foundry/hardhat/soldeer.

In the case that it's not, it's important to create a config file via the
command `aderyn init` in the workspace root.

For more examples, visit docs: https://cyfrin.gitbook.io/cyfrin-docs/aderyn-cli
Also ask questions via command line: `aderyn docs "how to configure scan options?"`

Help Aderyn stay open source by giving us a star on Github.
